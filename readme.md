# CUHWC Signupper

This tool runs a quick, local web server which serves a page allowing the collection of
emails for signups at freshers fairs.

## What it does:
- Serves a local web page (no internet required!)
- That lets people enter their CRS ID...
- ... or their email if they are non-cambridge
- and saves the resulting data to a timestamped text file

## Why not...
- ... A piece of paper? Because peoples' handwriting sucks and then someone has to type
  it all up into a spreadsheet.
- ... A google sheet? Because the spreadsheet interface is awkward for people to
  navigate at a stall and also they can see/maybe mess up previous entries. Also you
  might not have reliable internet.
- ... A google form? Because it looks a bit shit and requires multiple clicks. Also the
  internet again.


## How to run
- Download the latest release. 
- Run it
- It should open a browser. If it doesn't, go to http://localhost:1988
