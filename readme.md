# CUHWC Signupper

This repo contains a simple static web page that allows the easy collection of emails
for signups at freshers fairs.

## What it does:
- Shows a simple, offline (as in once it's loaded you don't need internet) page with
  an email input.
- That lets people enter their CRS ID...
- ... or their email if they are non-cambridge
- and saves the resulting data to the browser's local storage
- with a download button for later collection of the data

## Why not...
- ... A piece of paper? Because peoples' handwriting sucks and then someone has to type
  it all up into a spreadsheet.
- ... A google sheet? Because the spreadsheet interface is awkward for people to
  navigate at a stall and also they can see/maybe mess up previous entries. Also you
  might not have reliable internet.
- ... A google form? Because it looks a bit shit and requires multiple clicks. Also the
  internet again.


## How to use
- Go to https://cuhwc.github.io/signupper
- That's it
- Once you're done talking to freshers, click the download button in the bottom right
